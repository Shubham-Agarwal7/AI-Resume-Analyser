# AI-Resume-Analyser
Recruiters and hiring managers may miss qualified candidates or bias against particular groups unknowingly based on variables such as gender, race, or age. This might result in a less diversified and capable staff, affecting the organization's success. 
Additionally, the large number of resumes received in response to a single job advertisement might make it difficult for recruiters and hiring managers to rapidly select the most qualified individuals. This might lead to a lengthy recruitment procedure that frustrates both companies and job seekers.
The AI resume analyzer can provide recruiters with a list of top candidates that match the job description, making it easier for them to shortlist and evaluate candidates. This system can significantly improve the recruitment process's efficiency and help organizations hire the best talent for the job.
The current screening process is not efficient and often misses out on qualified candidates. There is a need for a system that can automatically analyze resumes and provide recruiters with a shortlist of candidates that match the job description.
The process of shortlisting resumes for job openings is time-consuming and requires significant effort from the recruiters. It is challenging to evaluate hundreds or thousands of resumes, and it becomes even more complicated when there are multiple job openings with varying job descriptions.
